## [Unreleased] - 2026-03-09
### Added
- `tools/review/sync_phase1_prs.sh` for pushing the active Phase 1 branch stack while preserving PR scope boundaries
- companion sidecar handling during `tagslut execute move-plan` and compatibility `move_from_plan.py` execution
- staged-root DJ FLAC tag enrichment via `tagslut intake process-root --phases dj`

### Changed
- `tagslut intake process-root --dry-run` now previews the DJ phase without writing FLAC tags, MP3s, or `dj_pool_path`
- active root and `docs/` Markdown files were refreshed to match the current v3 operator surface

## [3.0.1] — 2026-03-06
### Added
- tagslut/_web/ package: Flask DJ review app wired as tagslut report dj-review
- classification_v2 promotion script (tagslut index promote-classification)

### Fixed
- Silent except Exception blocks across 13 modules now log
- Provider IDs written in recovery mode
- Type annotations added to db_reader.py and enricher.py

## [3.0.0] — 2026-03-06

- Centralized move executor (tagslut.exec.engine) with MoveReceipt verification
- Policy engine (tagslut.policy) with deterministic planning and plan hashing
- V3 data model: asset_file, track_identity, asset_link, provenance_event, move_plan, move_execution tables
- DJ pipeline: gig builder, USB export, transcode, Rekordbox XML export
- Pre-download identity resolution (ISRC -> provider IDs -> fuzzy fallback)
- OneTagger ISRC enrichment wrappers (tools/tag, tag-build, tag-run)
- Classification v2: genre fallback + soft scoring (scripts/classify_tracks_sqlite.py)

### Changed

- Project description updated to management-first framing

### Removed
